# PredictorsMonitor
The PredictorsMonitor class is designed for monitoring and comparing statistical characteristics of predictors between an "etalon" dataset (used for training) and a test dataset. It supports both numerical and categorical predictors, providing insights into data drift or discrepancies that might affect model performance or data quality.
